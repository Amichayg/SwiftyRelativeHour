# SwiftyRelativeHour

This is a package building upon SwiftySunCalc to provide easy to use access to Relative Hour data in swift. 
This enables some pretty sleek time-keeping applications, and general support for alternative time display in pre-existing apps. 

## What's a relative hour exactly?
Relative Hours are a method of time measurmennt that seeks to utilize the day arc as the core foundation of time - taking the sunrise and sunset, and dividing them equally into 12 day-"hours". 
This enables a direct sync to the actual movements in the sky, enabling a global sense of time to emerge. 
Due to mechanical constraints, more logical, "counting" based methods of time keeping were developed, and are used today for constant time keeping. 

Modern computing and location tracking make relativity a breeze, and combined with a general shift towards actual physical descriptions instead of classical "approximations", it makes alot of sense to move towards relative timekeeping in almost any possible medium.
